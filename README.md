- If User input is 'rock' and Computer input is 'rock', it's a tie round.
- If User input is 'paper' and Computer input is 'rock', User wins round.
- If User input is 'paper' and Computer input is 'scissors', Computer wins round.
- If User input is 'paper' and Computer input is 'paper', it's a tie round.
- If User input is 'scissors' and Computer input is 'paper', User wins round.
- If User input is 'scissors' and Computer input is 'rock', Computer wins round.
- If User input is 'scissors' and Computer input is 'scissors', it's a tie round.
- If User wins the round, User will earn a point.
